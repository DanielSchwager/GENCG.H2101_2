# Day 03

## Clock

### Brief

Today we’ll work on building a device visualising the passing of time. Your design should be abstract enough and appear different at all times of the day. It should incorporate some kind of cycles as well. You should prevent from using letter and digits unless it’s highly relevant with your concept and used in a unique way.

While designing your clock ponder things like biological time (chronobiology), ultradian rhythms and infradian rhythms, solar and lunar cycles, celestial time, geological time, decimal time, historical time, psychological time, and subjective time.
